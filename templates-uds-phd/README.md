# PhD Thesis Template

This is the template for my PhD thesis at Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.

The structure is rather simple:

* `thesis.tex` is the main document, with corresponding bibliography in `bibliography.bib`
* Individual chapters, usually corresponding to published papers, can be found in `paperX`
* These chapters are organized in parts, each with a short abstract, see `partX.tex`
* `title.tex`, `abstract.tex`, `zusammenfassung.tex`, `dedication.tex` and `acknowledgements.tex` correspond
  to the title page, abstract, German abstract, dedication and acknowledgements and come before
  the main table of conents
* `packages.tex` contains any packages not automatically included by the template in `classicthesis_cw.sty`
* `commands.tex` contains additional global commands
